# Automated-alert-intimation-for-Road-Accident
Road accident detection using deep learning and automated email and buzzer alert system . 

**PROBLEM STATEMENT**<BR>
India has one of the highest rates of road accidents in the world, with an average of more than 400 deaths per day. According to the Ministry of Road Transport and Highways, there were a total of 4,37,396 road accidents in India in 2019, resulting in 1,54,732 deaths and 4,39,262 injuries.

The main causes of road accidents in India include:

* Over-speeding
* Drunk driving
* Distracted driving, such as using mobile phones while driving
* Poor road infrastructure and maintenance
* Overloading of vehicles
* Non-use of seatbelts and helmets
* Lack of awareness and education on road safety

The majority of road accidents in India involve two-wheelers, followed by cars, trucks, and buses. Pedestrians and cyclists are also at high risk of accidents due to the lack of proper infrastructure and awareness.The government has implemented various initiatives to improve road safety in India, including the implementation of stricter traffic laws, the promotion of road safety awareness, and the improvement of road infrastructure. However, there is still a long way to go to reduce the number of road accidents and fatalities in the country.

**OUR SOLUTION**<BR>
The goal of this project is to develop a system that can detect road accidents using computer vision techniques. The system will analyze live video feeds from CCTV cameras installed on roads and highways and identify any accidents that occur.The system should be able to detect various types of accidents, including collisions between two or more vehicles, single-vehicle accidents. It should also be able to distinguish between minor accidents and more serious ones, such as those that result in injuries or fatalities.The system should be able to operate in real-time and alert emergency services as soon as an accident is detected. The system should also be able to provide information about the location and severity of the accident to aid emergency services in their response.The system should be designed to minimize false positives and false negatives, ensuring that it only alerts emergency services when an accident has actually occurred. The system should also be scalable, allowing for the addition of more cameras and the processing of larger amounts of video data over time.The project will require expertise in computer vision, machine learning, and real-time data processing. The system should be developed with a focus on accuracy, reliability, and speed, to ensure that it can save lives and prevent injuries on the road.
